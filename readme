PR0GRAMMING LANGUAGE USED: JAVA
DEVELOPED ON ECLIPSE IDE AND SUCCESSFULLY TESTED ON OMEGA: WORKING


CODE STRUCTURE:

The package map contains 4 java files: map2.java,make.java, Milescomparator, getsucc.java

map2.java: It contains the main function and the functionality
make.java: to create the nodes we use this class
Milescomparator.java: To prioritize based on the pathcosts of the nodes in priority queue
getsucc.java: returns the hashmap like key:index of the arraylists and value the state node

The algorithms of treesearch and graph search with priority queue are strictly followed by the code structure and can be compared

HOW TO RUN:
1) In the map package go to 'src' then 'map' folder.
2)compile all the files by using the command:: javac *.java
3)then Copy the "input.txt" file to src
4)execute the command:: (java map.map2 input.txt source destination) from the src folder
5)output as expected.
